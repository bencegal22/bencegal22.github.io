                something funny so I'm just going to copy here something random.

                keyboard layout, you might want to keep your sanity and change the default code running 
                shortcut from CTRL-ALT-B to CTRL-R because the '}' symbol happens to be on the B key on
                hungarian layouts. To do this, go to File -> Preferences -> Keyboard shortcuts and search for run

            <dd>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it
                performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary 
                output.</dd>

            <dd>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only
                understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a'

            <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions 
                to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be

            <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various 
                kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to 
                create programs that implement specific algorithms.</dd>
